# Installation:

Make sure the Python packages 'pymongo', 'Flask' and 'Flask_Cors' are installed:

```python
pip install pymongo
pip install Flask
pip install Flask_Cors
```

# Usage:

Run the following command in the main directory:

```python
python start.py
```

This will start the Python Server, the React Application and open your browser to the correct page.

Alternatively, if the command does not work accordingly you can use the following commands in two seperate terminals:

React Terminal:

```typescript
cd React
npm install
npm run dev
```

Python Terminal:

```python
cd Server
python server.py
```

To upload new SBOMs to the database, you can use the Dockerfile located in the PythonScripts folder:

```
